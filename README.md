# Moving-Charge-in-a-Uniform-Magnetic-Field
1. In order to plot the trajectories of a moving charge in a uniform magnetic field, the equations of motion have been obtained using the Lagrangian approach.
2. Converting the coupled system of three Euler-Lagrange Equations(second-order ODEs) into the coupled system of six first0order ODEs and applying the predictor corrector-method, the above trajectories have been plotted.
