# Moving-Charge-in-a-Uniform-Magnetic-Field
1. In order to plot the trajectories of a moving charge in a uniform magnetic field, the equations of motion have been obtained using the Lagrangian approach and solved using the Predictor-Corrector method.
2. It shows only three possible trajectories namely linear, helical, and circular.
